## About

The tool will show you what is going to be reported and ask for your acknowledgement before uploading it. It will be mainly
invoked by a GUI, but it provides also a command line tool.

The Ubuntu welcome UI has a dedicated panel for this report collection and upload.

The command line tool as well as the Go and C API have different modes:
* Interactive mode (prompt displaying the data being sent and ask if sending or opting out)
* Only show the report
* Report automatically the collected data without prompting
* Report that you have opted out of data collection

By default, you can only report your data collection once per distribution version.

To execute the interactive command line interface manually, just use `ubuntu-report`.

## Service

In case we can't report (due to limited network or other networking conditions) your report when you act on it,
a little service will kick at login, and try to send the pending report data again. Note that it will exponentially
back off.

The service won't be active once the pending report is sent.

## APIS

### Go API

The Go API is used by the command line, but can be embedded as well by 3rd parties. Doc reference is available at
[![this link](https://godoc.org/github.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-report?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-report/pkg/sysmetrics).

### C API

The C API is provided for embedding the library in C code. Doc reference is available at
[![this link](https://godoc.org/github.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-report?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-report/pkg/sysmetrics/C).

You can generate the shared library and headers by running `go generate`.

## Command line options

You can regenerate previous README section, shell completion support and man pages by simply running `go generate`.
